<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>he first and second edition of our Book of Wild Flowers was published last year
under the title of “CANADIAN WILD FLOWERS;” but it has been suggested
by some American friends that we ought not to have limited the title to the
Wild Flowers of <span class='it'>Canada</span>, as nature has given them a much wider geographical
range, and, in fact, there are none of those that have been portrayed and described
in our volume but may be found diffused over the whole of the Eastern and Northern
States of the Union, as well as to the North and West of the Great Lakes. We, therefore,
have rectified the error in our present issue, not wishing to put asunder those
whom the Great Creator has united in one harmonious whole, each family and tribe
finding its fitting place as when it issued freshly forth from the bounteous hand of
God who formed it for the use of His creatures and to His own honor and glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As our present volume embraces but a select few of the Native Flowers of this
Northern Range of the Continent, it is our intention to follow it by succeeding series,
which will present to our readers the most attractive of our lovely Wild Flowers, and
flowering shrubs. The subject offers a wide field for our future labours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a garland of loveliness has nature woven for man’s admiration, and yet,
comparatively speaking, how few appreciate the beauties thus lavishly bestowed
upon them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inhabitants of the crowded cities know little of them even by name, and
those that dwell among them pass them by as though they heeded them not, or
regarded them as worthless weeds, crying, “Cut them down, why cumber they the
ground?” To such careless ones they do indeed “waste their sweetness on the desert
air.” Yet the Wild Flowers have deeper meanings and graver teachings than the
learned books of classical lore so much prized by the scholar, if he will but receive
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shew him the parental care of a benificent God for the winged creatures of
the air, and for the sustenance of the beasts of the field. They point to the better
life, the resurrection from the darkness of the grave. They are emblems of man’s
beauty and of his frailty. They lend us by flowery paths from earth to heaven, where
the flowers fade not away. Shall we then coldly disregard the flowers that our God
has made so wondrously fair, to beautify the earth we live on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mothers of America teach your little ones to love the Wild Flowers and they will
love the soil on which they grew, and in all their wanderings through the world their
hearts will turn back with loving reverence to the land of their birth, to that dear
home endeared to their hearts by the remembrance of the flowers that they plucked
and wove for their brows in their happy hours of gladsome childhood.</p>

<div><h1>DESCRIPTION OF THE TITLE PAGE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Our Artist has tastefully combined in the wreath that adorns her title page
several of our native Spring Flowers. The simple blossoms of <span class='it'>Claytonia Virginica</span>,
better known by its familiar name “<span class='sc'>Spring Beauty</span>,” may easily be recognized from
the right hand figure in the group of the first plate in the book. For a description of
it see page 16.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall slender flower on the left side on the title page is <span class='it'>Potentilla Canadensis</span>,
(Var <span class='it'>simplex</span>). This slender trailing plant may be found in open grassy thickets,
by road side wastes, at the foot of old stumps, and similar localities, with the common
Cinquefoil or Silver Leaf. This last species is much the most attractive plant to the
lover of wild flowers. It abounds in dry gravelly and sandy soil, courting the open
sunshine, rooting among stones, over which it spreads its slender reddish stalk, enlivening
the dry arid wastes with its silvery silken leaves and gay golden rose-shaped
blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Potentilla family belongs to the same Natural Order, <span class='sc'>Rosaceæ</span>, as the Strawberry,
Raspberry, Blackberry and the Rose—a goodly fellowship of the useful and
the beautiful among which our humble Cinquefoil has been allowed to find a place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little plant occupying the lower portion of the plate is <span class='it'>Viola sagittata</span>,
“<span class='sc'>Arrow Leaved Violet</span>.” The anthers of the stamens are flesh coloured or pale
orange; the slender pointed sepals of the calyx are of a bright light green, which form
a lively contrast to the deep purple closely wrapped pointed buds that they enfold.
The leaves are of a dull green, somewhat hairy, narrow, blunt at the apex, not heart-shaped
as in many of the species but closed at the base and bordering the short
channelled foot-stalk. Among our numerous species few are really more lovely than
“the Arrow Leaved Violet.” <span class='it'>Viola ovata</span> and <span class='it'>Viola villosa</span> closely resemble the above,
and probably are varieties of our pretty flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The violet, like the rose and lily, has ever been the poet’s flower. This is not one
of our earliest violets; it blossoms later than the early white violet, <span class='it'>V. rotundifolia</span>
or than the early Blue Violet, <span class='it'>V. cucullata</span>, or that delicate species <span class='it'>V. striata</span>, the
lilac striped violet, which adorns the banks and hill sides on some of our plain lands,
early in the month of May. Later in this month and in the beginning of June we
find the azure blossoms of <span class='it'>V. sagittata</span> in warm sheltered valleys, often among groups
of small pines and among grasses on sandy knolls and open thickets. The plant
grows low, the leaves on very short foot-stalks closely pressed to the ground; the
bright full blue flowers springing from the crown of the plant on long slender stems
stand above the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The petals are blunt, of a full azure blue, white at the base and bearded. Among
many allusions to this favourite flower, here are lines somewhat after the style of the
older poets, addressed to early violets found on a wintry March day at Waltham
<a id='abby'></a>Abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Canada does not boast among her violets the sweet purple violet
(<span class='it'>Viola odorata</span>) of Britain she has many elegant species remarkable for beauty of
form and colour; among these “The Yellow Wool Violet,” the “Song Spurred Violet”
and the “Milkwhite Wool Violet,” (<span class='it'>V. Canadensis</span>) may be named. These are all
branching violets, some, as the yellow and the white, often attain, in rank shaded soil,
to a foot in height and may be found throwing out a succession of flowers through
the later summer months. They will bloom freely if transplanted to a shady spot in
the garden.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE American poet, Bryant, has many happy allusions to the
Hepatica under the name of “<span class='sc'>Wind-Flower</span>;” the more
common name among our Canadian settlers is “<span class='sc'>Snow-Flower</span>,”
it being the first blossom that appears directly
after the melting off of the winter snows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the forest—in open grassy old woods, on banks and upturned
roots of trees, this sweet flower gladdens the eye with its cheerful
starry blossoms; every child knows it and fills its hands and bosom
with its flowers, pink, blue, deep azure and pure white. What the
daisy is to England, the Snow-flower or Liver-leaf is to Canada.
It lingers long within the forest shade, coyly retreating within its
sheltering glades from the open glare of the sun: though for a time
it will not refuse to bloom within the garden borders, when transplanted
early in spring, and doubtless if properly supplied with black
mould from the woods and partially sheltered by shrubs it would
continue to grow and flourish with us constantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have two sorts, <span class='it'>H. acutiloba</span>, and <span class='it'>H. triloba</span>. A large variety
has been found on Long Island in Rice Lake; the leaves of which
are <span class='it'>five lobed</span>; the lobes much rounded, the leaf stalks stout, densely
silky, the flowers large, of a deep purple blue. This handsome plant
throve under careful cultivation and proved highly ornamental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small round closely folded buds of the Hepatica appear before
the white silky leaves unfold themselves, though many of the old
leaves of the former year remain persistent through the winter. The
buds rise from the centre of a silken bed of soft sheaths and young
leaves, as if nature kindly provided for the warmth and protection of
these early flowers with parental care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the season, the young leaves expand just before the
flowers drop off. The white flowered is the most common among our
Hepaticas, but varieties may be seen of many hues: waxen-pink, pale
blue and azure blue with intermediate shades and tints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hepatica belongs to the Nat. Ord. Ranunculaceæ, the crow-foot
family, but possesses none of the acrid and poisonous qualities of
the Ranunculus proper, being used in medicine, as a mild tonic, by the
American herb doctors in fevers and disorders of the liver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very probable that its healing virtues in complaints of the
liver gave rise to its common name in old times; some assign the name
to the form of the lobed leaf.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS slender drooping flower of early spring is known by
the name of <span class='sc'>Bellwort</span>, from its pendent lily-like bells;
and by some it is better known as the <span class='it'>Wood Daffodil</span>, to
which its yellow blossoms bear some remote resemblance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers of the Bellwort are of a pale greenish-yellow; the
divisions of the petal-like sepals are six, deeply divided, pointed and
slightly twisted or waved, drooping from slender thready pedicels
terminating the branches; the stem of the plant is divided into two
portions, one of which is barren of flowers. The leaves are of a
pale green, smooth, and in the largest species perfoliate, clasping
the stem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The root (or rhizome) is white, fleshy and tuberous. The Bellwort
is common in rich shady woods and grassy thickets, and on
moist alluvial soil on the banks of streams, where it attains to the
height of 18 or 20 inches. It is an elegant, but not very showy flower—remarkable
more for its graceful pendent straw-coloured or pale
yellow blossoms, than for its brilliancy. It belongs to a sub-order of
the Lily Tribe. There are three species in Canada—the large Bellwort—<span class='it'>Uvularia
grandiflora</span> and <span class='it'>U. perfoliata</span>—we also possess the
third, enumerated by Dr. Gray, <span class='it'>U. sessilifolia</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE classical name <span class='sc'>Anemone</span> is derived from a Greek word,
which signifies the <span class='it'>wind</span>, because it was thought that the
flower opened out its blossoms only when the wind was
blowing. Whatever the habits of the Anemone of the
Grecian Isles may be, assuredly in their native haunts in this country,
the blossoms open alike in windy weather or in calm; in shade or in
sunshine. It is more likely that the wind acting upon the downy
seeds of some species and dispersing them abroad, has been the origin
of the idea, and has given birth to the popular name which poets
have made familiar to the ear with many sweet lines. Bryant, who
is the American poet of nature, for he seems to revel in all that is
fair among the flowers and streams and rocks and forest shades, has
also given the name of “<span class='it'>wind flower</span>” to the blue hepatica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of our plate, the little white pink-edged flower
at the left hand corner of the group, is <span class='it'>Anemone nemorosa</span>, the
smaller “<span class='sc'>Wood Anemone</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This pretty delicate species loves the moderate shade of groves
and thickets, it is often found in open pinelands of second growth,
and evidently prefers a light and somewhat sandy soil to any other,
with glimpses of sunshine stealing down upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wood Anemone is from 4 to 9 inches in height, but seldom
taller, the five rounded sepals which form the flower are white, tinged
with a purplish-red or dull pink on the outside. The leaves are three
parted, divided again in three, toothed and sharply cut and somewhat
coarse in texture; the three upper stem leaves form an involucre
about midway between the root and the flower-cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Wood Anemone is a cheerful little flower gladdening us with
its blossoms early in the month of May. It is very abundant in the
neighbourhood of Toronto, on the grassy banks and piny-dells at
Dover Court, and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A somewhat taller species, with very white starry flowers, is
found on gravelly banks under the shade of shrubs near the small
lakes formed by the Otonabee river, <span class='it'>N. Douro</span>, where also, we find
the downy seeded species known as “Thimble-weed,” <span class='it'>Anemone cylindrica</span>,
from the cylindrical heads of fruit. The “Thimble-weed” is not
very attractive for beauty of colour; the flower is greenish-white,
small, two of the sepals being shorter and less conspicuous than the
others; the plant is from 1 to 2 ft. high; the leaves of the cut and
pointed <a id='invol'></a>involucre are coarse, of a dull green, surrounding the several
long flower-stalks. The soft cottony seeds remain in close heads
through the winter, till the spring breezes disperse them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The largest species of our native Anemones is <span class='it'>A. Virginiana</span>,
“<span class='sc'>Tall Anemone</span>.” This handsome plant loves the shores of lakes
and streams; damp rich ground suits it well, as it grows freely in such
soil, and under moderate shade when transferred to the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foliage of the tall Anemone is coarse, growing in whorls
round the stem, divisions of the leaf three parted, sharply pointed
and toothed. In this, as in all the species, the coloured sepals, (or
calyx leaves) form the flower. The outer surface of the flower is
covered with minute silky hairs, the round flattened silky buds rise
singly on tall naked stems, the upper series are supplied with two
small leaflets embracing the stalk. The central and largest flowers
open first, the lateral or outer ones as these fade away; thus a succession
of blossoms is produced, which continue to bloom for several
weeks. The flowers of this sort, under cultivation, become larger and
handsomer than in their wild state, ivory white, tinged with purple.
The Anemone is always a favourite flower wherever it may be seen,
whether in British woods, on Alpine heights, or in Canadian wilds;
on banks of lonely lakes and forest streams; or in the garden parterre,
where it is rivalled by few other flowers in grace of form or
splendour of colour.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS simple delicate little plant is one of our earliest April
flowers. In warm springs it is almost exclusively an
April flower, but in cold and backward seasons, it often
delays its blossoming time till May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partially hidden beneath the shelter of old decaying timbers
and fallen boughs, its pretty pink buds peep shyly forth. It is often
found in partially cleared beech-woods, and in rich moist meadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Canada, there are two species; one with few flowers, white,
both leaves and flowers larger than the more common form; the
blossoms of the latter are more numerous, smaller, and of a pale pink
colour, veined with lines of a deeper rose colour, forming a slender
raceme; sometimes the little pedicels or flower stalks are bent or
twisted to one side, so as to throw the flowers in one direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scape springs from a small deep tuber, bearing a single pair
of soft, oily, succulent leaves. In the white flowered species these
leaves are placed about midway up the stem, but in the pink (<span class='it'>C.
Virginica</span>) the leaves lie closer to the ground, and are smaller and
of a dark bluish green hue. Our <span class='sc'>Spring Beauty</span> well deserves its
pretty poetical name. It comes in with the Robin, and the song
sparrow, the hepatica, and the first white violet; it lingers in shady
spots, as if unwilling to desert us till more sunny days have wakened
up a wealth of brighter blossoms to gladden the eye; yet the first,
and the last, are apt to be most prized by us, with flowers, as well
as other treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How infinitely wise and merciful are the arrangements of the
Great Creator. Let us instance the connection between <span class='sc'>Bees</span> and
<span class='sc'>Flowers</span>. In cold climates the former lie torpid, or nearly so,
during the long months of Winter, until the genial rays of the sun
and light have quickened vegetation into activity, and buds and
blossoms open, containing the nutriment necessary for this busy
insect tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='sc'>Bees</span> seem made for the Blossoms; the <span class='sc'>Blossoms</span> for the
<span class='sc'>Bees</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a bright March morning what sound can be more in harmony
with the sunshine and blue skies, than the murmuring of the honeybees,
in a border of cloth of gold crocuses? what sight more cheerful
to the eye? But I forget. Canada has few of these sunny flowers,
and no March days like those that woo the hive bees from their
winter dormitories. And April is with us only a name. We have
no April month of rainbow suns and showers. We miss the deep
blue skies, and silver throne-like clouds that cast their fleeting
shadows over the tender springing grass and corn; we have no mossy
lanes odorous with blue violets. One of our old poets thus writes:</p>

<p class='noindent'>We miss the turfy banks, studded with starry daisies, pale primroses
and azure blue-bells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our May is bright and sunny, more like to the English March;
it is indeed a month of promise—a month of many flowers. But
too often its fair buds and blossoms are nipped by frost, “and winter,
lingering, chills the lap of May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the warmth and shelter of the forest, vegetation appears.
The black leaf mould, so light and rich, quickens the seedlings into
rapid growth, and green leaves and opening buds follow soon after
the melting of the snows of winter. The starry blossoms of the
hepatica, blood-root, bellwort, violets, white, yellow and blue, with
the delicate Coptis (gold-thread), come forth and are followed by
many a lovely flower, increasing with the more genial seasons of
May and June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But our April flowers are but few, comparatively speaking, and
so we prize our early Violets, Hepaticas and Spring Beauty.</p>

woodlands, large beds of these elegant lilies may be
seen piercing the softened ground in the month of April;
the broad lanceolate leaves are beautifully clouded with
purple or reddish brown, or sometimes with milky white. Each
bulb of the <span class='it'>second</span> year’s growth produces two leaves, and between
these rises a round naked scape, (or flower stem), terminated by a
drooping yellow bell. The unfolded bud is striped with lines of
dark purple. A few hours of sunshine and warm wind soon expands
the flower, which is composed of six coloured sepals, recurved,
which form a lily-like turbaned flower; each segment grooved, and
spotted at the base, with oblong purplish brown dots. The outer
surface of the sepals is marked with dark lines. The stamens are
six; anthers, oblong; pollen of a brick-red, or dull orange colour,
varying to yellow. The style is club-shaped; stigmas three, united.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This elegant yellow lily bends downward when expanded, as if to
hide its glories from the full glare of the sun-light. The clouded
leaves are of an oily smoothness, resisting the moisture of rain and
dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name Dogs-tooth Violet seems very inappropriate. The
pointed segments of the bell may have suggested the resemblance
to the tooth of a dog, but it is difficult to trace any analogy between
this flower and the violet, no two plants presenting greater dissimilarity
of form or habit than the lily and the violet, though often
blended in the verse of the poet. The American name of the

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-N.jpg' style='float:left;width:9%;' alt='N'/>ATURE has scattered with no niggardly hand these remarkable
flowers over hill and dale, wide shrubby plain
and shady forest glen. In deep ravines, or rocky islets,
the bright snow-white blossoms of the Trilliums greet the
eye and court the hand to pluck them. The old people in this part
of the Province call them by the familiar name of Lily. Thus we
have <span class='it'>Asphodel Lilies</span>, <span class='it'>Douro Lilies</span>, <span class='it'>&amp;c.</span> In Nova Scotia they are
called Moose-flowers, probably from being abundant in the haunts of
Moose-deer. In some of the New England States the Trilliums,
white and red, are known as the <span class='it'>Death-flower</span>, but of the origin of so
ominous a name we have no record. We might imagine it to have
originated in the use of the flower to deck the coffin or graves of
the dead in the olden times. The pure white blossoms of <span class='it'>T. nivale</span>,
<span class='it'>T. cernum</span> (nodding Trillium) and <span class='it'>T. grandiflorum</span>, might serve not
inappropriately for emblems of innocence and purity, when laid upon
the breast of the early dead. The darker and more sanguine hue
of the red species, <span class='it'>T. sessile</span>, and <span class='it'>T. recurvatum</span>, might have been
selected for such as fell by violence, but these are but conjecture.
A prettier name has been given to the Nodding Trillium: that of
“Smiling Wake-robin,” which seems to be associated with the coming
of the cheerful chorister of early spring, “The household bird with the
red stomacher,” as Bishop Carey calls the robin red-breast. The botanical
name of the Trillium is derived from trilex, triple, all the parts
of the plant being in threes. Thus we see the round fleshy scape
furnished with three large sad green leaves, closely set round the
stem, two or three inches below the flower; which is composed of
a calyx of <span class='it'>three</span> sepals, a corolla of <span class='it'>three</span> large snow-white, or, else,
chocolate red petals: the styles or stigmas <span class='it'>three</span>; ovary <span class='it'>three</span> celled;
stamens <span class='it'>six</span>, which is a duplicate of three. The white fleshy tuberous
root is much used by the American School of Medicine in various
diseases, also by the Indian herb doctors.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Trillium grandiflorum</span> is the largest and most showy of the white
species. <span class='it'>Trillium nivale</span> or “lesser snowy Trillium,” is the smallest;
the last blooms <span class='it'>early</span> in May. May and June are the months in
which these flowers appear. The white flowered Trilliums are subject
to many varieties and accidental alterations. The green of the
sepals is often transferred to the white petals in <span class='it'>T. nivale</span>; some
are found handsomely striped with red and green, and in others the
very short foot-stalk of the almost sessile leaves are lengthened into
long petioles. The large White Trillium is changed previous to its
fading to a dull reddish lilac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red Trilliums are rich but sombre in colour, the petals are
longish-ovate, regular, not waved, and the pollen is of a greyish dusty
hue while that of the White species is bright orange-yellow. The
leaves are of a dark lurid green, the colouring matter of the petals
seems to pervade the leaves; and here, let me observe, that the
same remark may be made of many other plants. In purple flowers
we often perceive the violet hue to be perceptible in the stalk and
under part of the leaves, and sometimes in the veins and roots. Red
flowers again show the same tendency in stalk and veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blood-root in its early stage of growth shews the Orange
juice in the stem and leaves, so does the Canadian Balsam and
many others; that, a little observation will point out. The colouring
matter of flowers has always been, more or less, a mystery to
us: that light is one of the great agents can hardly for a moment
be doubted, but something also may depend upon the peculiar
quality of the juices that fill the tissues of the flower, and on
the cellular tissue itself. Flowers deprived of light, we know, are
pallid and often colourless, but how do we account for the deep
crimson of the beet-root, the rose-red of the radish, the orange of
the rhubarb, carrot, and turnip, which roots, being buried in the
earth, are not subject to the solar rays? The natural supposition
would be that all roots hidden from the light would be white, but
this is by no means the case. The question is one of much interest,
and deserves the attention of all naturalists, and especially of the
botanical student.</p>

May and June by its brilliant blossoms of deep red and
golden yellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general outline the Wild Columbine resembles its
cultivated sisters of the garden, but is more light and airy from its
nodding habit. The plant throws up many tall slender stalks from
its centre, furnished with leafy bracts, from which spring other light
stems terminated by little pedicels, each bearing a large drooping
flower and bud which open in succession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flower consists of five red sepals and five red petals; the
latter are hollowed trumpet-like at the mouth, ascending; they form
narrow tubes, which are terminated by little round knobs filled with
honey. The delicate thready pedicels on which the blossom hangs
cause it to droop down and thus throw up the honey bearing tubes
of the petals; the little balls forming a pretty sort of floral coronet
at the junction with the stalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unequal and clustered stamens, and five thready styles of
the pistil project beyond the hollow mouths of the petals, like an
elegant golden-fringed tassel; the edges and interior of the petals
are also of a bright golden yellow. These gay colours are well
contrasted with the deep green of the root leaves and bracts of the
flower stalks. The bracts are lobed in two or three divisions. The
larger leaves are placed on long foot stalks; each leaf is divided into
three, which are again twice or thrice lobed, and unequally notched;
the upper surface is smooth and of a dark rich green, the under pale
and whitish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the flowers fade the husky hollow seed pods become erect—a
wise provision in this and many other plants of drooping habits,
giving the ripening seed better access to the sun and wind, and preventing
them from being prematurely scattered abroad upon the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wild Columbine<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> is perennial and very easily cultivated. Its
blossoms are eagerly sought out by the bees and humming birds.
On sunny days you may be sure to see the latter hovering over the
bright drooping bells, extracting the rich nectar with which they are
so bountifully supplied. Those who care for bees, and love humming
birds, should plant the graceful red-flowered Columbine in their
garden borders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its wild state it is often found growing among rocks and surface
stones, where it insinuates its roots into the clefts and hollows
that are filled with rich vegetable mould; and thus, being often
seen adorning the sterile rocks with its bright crown of waving
blossoms, it has obtained the name, in some places, of <span class='sc'>Rock Columbine.</span></p>

Hyacinth</span>.” The common name of “Squirrel-Corn” is derived from
the round orange tubers at the roots, resembling in size and colour
grains of Indian-Corn, and from their being a favourite food with the
ground squirrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blossoms are of a pellucid whiteness, sometimes tinged
with reddish lilac; they form a drooping raceme on a round smooth
scape, springing from a scaly bud; the corolla is heart-shaped,
composed of four petals, in two pairs, flattened and sac-like, the tips
united over the stigma, and slightly projecting; in <span class='it'>D. cucullaria</span>
assuming the likeness of the head of a fly, the cream-coloured
diverging petals presenting a strong resemblance to the deer-fly of
our lakes. This very charming species is known by the somewhat
vulgar name of “<span class='sc'>Breeches Flower</span>” and “<span class='sc'>Dutchman’s Breeches</span>.”
A more descriptive name would be “<span class='sc'>Fly-Flower</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the species flourish under cultivation, and become very
ornamental early border flowers; but care should be taken to plant
them in rich black vegetable mould, the native soil of their forest
haunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our artist has chosen the delicate rosy-tinted variety as the
subject of the right hand flower of the plate.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-G.jpg' style='float:left;width:9%;' alt='G'/>RAY and other botanical writers call this striking flower
(<span class='it'>T. erectum</span>) the “<span class='it'>Purple Trillium</span>;” it should rather
be called <span class='sc'>Red</span>, its hue being decidedly more <span class='it'>red</span> than
purple, and in the New England States it is called by
the country folks, “The Red Death-Flower,” in contrast to the
larger White Trillium, or “<span class='sc'>White Death-Flower</span>.” For further
remarks on this singular name we refer the reader to the description
of that flower where all the native varieties of the genus are dwelt
upon, including the one now before us, which forms the central
flower in the present group, and shall merely add that like the rest
of this remarkable family, <span class='it'>T. erectum</span> is widely spread over the whole
of Canada. It appears in the middle of May and continues blooming
till June, preferring the soil of rich shady woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Few of our indigenous plants surpass the Trillium in elegance
and beauty, and they are all endowed with valuable medicinal properties.
The root of the Purple Trillium is generally believed to be
the most active. Tannin and Bitter Extract form two of its most
remarkable ingredients.” So says that intelligent writer on the
medicinal plants of North America, Dr. Charles Lee. There are
three of the dark flowered Trillium enumerated by Gray, two of
which appear to be common to our Canadian soil, <span class='it'>T. erectum</span> and
<span class='it'>T. sessile</span>. The latter is smaller, and often the dull chocolate colour
of the pointed petals assumes a livid greenish hue. It is earlier in
flowering, appearing at the beginning of May, at the same time with
<span class='it'>T. nivale</span>, the “Dwarf White” or “<span class='sc'>Snowy Trillium</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under cultivation the flowers of all the species become very
ornamental; they require black leaf mould and moderate shade,
and, if left to grow undisturbed, increase and continue to flower year
after year, in the borders or shrubbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seeds when ripe are easily obtained; they are hard and
bony, several in each division of the three celled capsule. The roots
of these plants are thick, wrinkled, fleshy, and contain the medicinal
principle described by Dr. Lee.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HERE are but few flowers of the Cranes-bill family in Canada.
The one most worthy of notice is the Wood Geranium
(<span class='it'>Geranium maculatum</span>). This is a very ornamental plant:
its favourite locality is open grassy thickets among low
bushes, especially those tracts of country known as Oak-openings,
where it often reaches to the height of from 2° to 3°, throwing out
many branches adorned with deep lilac flowers; the half-opened buds
are very lovely. The blossom consists of five petals, obtuse and
slightly indented on their upper margins, and are lined and delicately
veined with purple. The calyx consists of five pointed sepals; stamens
ten; the anthers are of a reddish brown; styles five, cohering at the
top. When the seed is mature these curl up, bearing the ripe brown
seed adhering to the base of each one. The common name Cranes-bill
has been derived from the long grooved and stork-like beak
which supports the <a id='stig'></a>stigma. The Greek name of the plant means a
Crane. The whole plant is more or less beset with silvery hairs.
The leaves are divided into about five principal segments; these
again are lobed and cut into sharply pointed irregularly sized teeth.
The larger hairy root leaves are often discoloured with red and purplish
blotches, from whence the specific name (<span class='it'>maculatum</span>) spotted,
has been given by botanists to this species.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flower stem is much branched and furnished with leafy
bracts; the principal flowers are on long stalks, usually three springing
from a central branch and again subdividing into smaller branchlets
terminating in buds mostly in threes, on drooping slender pedicels;
as the older and larger blossoms fall off a fresh succession appears on
the side branches, furnishing rather smaller but equally beautiful
flowers during many weeks. Gray gives the blooming season of the
Cranes-bill from April to July, but with us it rarely appears before
June, and may be seen all through July and August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Wood Geranium is a beautiful species, and would no doubt
repay the trouble of cultivation. Besides being very ornamental
our plant possesses virtues which are well known to the herbalist as
powerful astringents, which quality has obtained for it the name of
‘<span class='it'>Alum root</span>’ among the country people, who apply a decoction of
the root as a styptic for wounds; and sweetened, as a gargle for sore
throats and ulcerated mouth: it is also given to young children to
correct a lax state of the system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus our plant is remarkable for its usefulness as well as for its
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A showy species, with large rose-coloured flowers and much
dissected leaves, may be found on some of the rocky islets in Stoney
Lake, Ont. The slender flower stem is about six inches in height,
springing from a leafy involucre which is cut and divided into many
long and narrow segments; flowers generally from one to three,
terminal on the little bracted-foot-stalks. The seed vessels not so
long as in the Wood Geranium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the above named we have two smaller species. The
well known <span class='sc'>Herb Robert</span>—<span class='it'>G. Robertianum</span> or fœtid geranium—which
is said to have been introduced from Britain, but is by no
means uncommon in Canada, in half cleared woodlands and by waysides
attracting the eye by its bright pink flowers, and elegantly cut
leaves, which becomes bright red in the fall of the year. This
pretty species is renowned for its rank and disagreeable odour when
handled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another small flowered species, with pale insignificant blossoms
is also common as a weed by road sides and in open woods, probably
this is <span class='it'>G. pusilum</span>, smaller Cranes-bill; it also resembles the British
plant, but is of too frequent occurrence in remote localities to lead
us to suppose it to be otherwise than a native production of the soil.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS pretty starry-flowered little plant is remarkable for the
occurrence of the number seven in its several parts,
and was for some time regarded by botanists of the old
school as the representative of the Class Heptandria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The calyx is seven parted; the divisions of the delicate white
corolla also seven; and the stamens seven. The leaves form a
whorl at the upper part of the stem, mostly from five to seven, or
eight; the leaves are narrow, tapering at both ends, of a delicate
light-green, thin in texture, and of a pleasant sub-acid flavour. The
star-shaped flowers, few in number, on thread-like stalks, rise from
the centre of the whorl of leaves, which thus form an involucre to
the pretty delicate starry flowers. This little plant is frequently
found at the roots of beech-trees; it is fond of shade, and in light
vegetable mould forms considerable beds; the roots are white,
slender, and fibrous; it is one of our early May flowers, though,
unless the month be warm and genial, will delay its opening somewhat
later. In old times, when the herbalists gave all kinds of
fanciful names to the wild plants, they would have bestowed such a
name as “<span class='sc'>Herbe Innocence</span>” upon our modest little forest flower.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE familiar name “Wintergreen” is applied by the Canadians
to many species of dwarf evergreen plants without any
reference to their natural affinities. The beautiful family
of Pyrolas share this name in common with many other
charming forest flowers in reference to their evergreen habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every member of this interesting family is worthy of special
notice. Elegant in form and colouring, of a delicate fragrance and
enduring verdure, they add to their many attractions the merit of
being almost the first green thing to refresh the eye long wearied by
gazing on the dazzling snow for many consecutive months of winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the dissolving crust disappears from the forest beneath the
kindly influence of the transient sunbeams of early spring, the deep
glossy-green shoots of the hardy Pyrolas peep forth, not timidly, as
if afraid to meet</p>

<p class='noindent'>not shrinking from the chilling blast that too often nips the fair
promise of April and May, but boldly and cheerfully braving the
worst that the capricious season has in store for such early risers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All bright, and fresh, and glossy, our Wintergreens come forth as
though they had been perfecting their toilet within the sheltering
canopy of their snowy chambers, to do honour to the new-born year
just awakening from her icy sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>P. elliptica</span> forms extensive beds in the forest, the roots creeping
with running subterranean shoots which send up clusters of evergreen
leaves, slightly waved and scalloped at the edges, of a deep
glossy green and thin in texture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name Pyrola is derived from a fancied likeness in the foliage
to that of the Pear, but this is not very obvious, nevertheless we will
not cavil at it, for it is a pretty sounding word, far better than many
a one that has been bestowed upon our showy wild flowers, in compliment
to the person that first brought them into notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pale-greenish white flower of our Pyrola forms a tall terminal
raceme, the five round petals are hollow; each blossom set on a
slender pedicle, at the base of which is a small pointed bract; the
anthers are of a reddish orange colour, the stamens ascending in a
cluster, while the long style is declined, forming a figure somewhat
like the letter J. The seed vessel is ribbed berry-shaped, slightly
flattened and turbinate; when dry, the light chaffy seeds escape
through valves at the sides. The dry style in this and most of the
genus remain persistent on the capsule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number 5 prevails in this plant; the calyx is 5 parted;
petals 5; stamens 10, or twice five; stigma one, but 5 rayed; 5 knobs
or tubercles at the apex; seed-vessel 5-celled and 5-valved. The
flowers are generally from 5 to 10 on the scape. Most of our Pyrolas
are remarkable for the rich fragrance of their flowers, especially <span class='it'>P.
rotundifolia</span>, <span class='it'>P. elliptica</span>, <span class='it'>P. incarnata</span> and <span class='it'>P. minor</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These flowers are, for the most part, found in rich woods, some
in low wet ground, but a few prefer the drier soil of piny forests, and
one of the finest and most fragrant of the species grows freely on
grassy uplands, the larger flowered <span class='it'>P. rotundifolia</span> (round-leaved
Pyrola).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exquisitely beautiful evergreen plant known by Canadian
settlers as <span class='it'>Prince’s Pine</span> is a member of the family of Pyrola.
From root to summit this plant is altogether lovely. The leaves
are dark, shining and smooth, evergreen and finely serrated; the
stem of a bright rosy-red; the delicately pink-tinted flowers look as
if moulded from wax; the anthers are of a bright amethyst-purple,
set round the emerald-green turbinated stigma. The flowers are not
many, but form a loose corymb springing from the centre of the
shining green leaves. There is scarcely a more attractive native
plant than the <span class='it'>Chimaphila umbellata</span> in our Canadian flora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaves of this beautiful Wintergreen are held in high
estimation by Indian herbalists who call it <span class='sc'>Rheumatism Weed</span>,
(<span class='it'>Pipissewa</span>). It is bitter and aromatic in quality.</p>

the forest, in rich black leaf mould, where, like <span class='it'>P. elliptica</span>,
it forms considerable beds; it is of evergreen habit. The
leaves are of a dark green and smooth surface, clustered
at the base of the running root-stalk and sending up from the centre
one simple scape, bearing a gracefully nodding flower; each milk-white
petal is elegantly scalloped; the stamens, 8 to 10, are set
close to the base of the petal; the anthers are of a bright purple
amethyst colour; the style straight, with five radiating points at the
extremity forming a perfect mural crown in shape: it is of a bright
green and much exceeds in length the stamen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scent of the flower is very fine, resembling in richness that
of the hyacinthe. This species is not common. There is another
variety of the single-flowered Pyrola that is of more frequent occurrence
in our woods. The flower is of a greenish white, the anthers
of a brownish fawn colour, the whole height of the plant scarcely
exceeding four or five inches, and the scent is less fragrant than that
of the pure white single Pyrola (<span class='it'>Moneses uniflora</span>).</p>

what can be more lovely than its rose-shaped blossoms, from the
deep purplish-crimson bud wrapped in its odorous mossy calyx, to
the unfolded flower of various shades of deep rose and paler reddish
lilac. The flowers of the Red Raspberry derive their pleasant aromatic
odour from the closely-set coating of short bristly glandular
hairs, each one of which is tipped with a gland of reddish hue, containing
a sweet-scented gum, as in the mossy envelope of the moss-rose

The blossoms are often as large as those of the sweet-briar and dog-rose,
but when first unfolded more compact and cup like. The fruit
consists of many small red grains arranged in the form of an inverted
saucer on the receptacle, and is somewhat dry and acid, more tempting
to the eye than the palate, but not injurious in any degree. The
shrub is more attractive for its flowers than its insipid fruit. We

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS ornamental family are remarkable alike for the singular
beauty of their flowers, and the peculiar arrangement of
the internal organs. In the Linnæan classification they
were included in common, with all the Orchis tribe, in
the class Gynandria, but in the Natural Order of Jussieu, which we
have followed, the “Lady’s Slipper” (<span class='it'>Cypripedium</span>), forms one of the
sub-orders in the general Order <span class='sc'>Orchidaceæ</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the two species represented in our Artist’s group, the larger
and central flower is <span class='it'>Cypripedium pubescens</span>, the smaller, <span class='it'>C. parviflorum</span>,
or <span class='sc'>Lesser Lady’s Slipper</span>. The latter is, perhaps, the more elegant
and graceful plant, and is also somewhat fragrant. The sepals and
petals are longer and more spiral, but the colouring of the lip is not
so rich and vivid as in the larger flower, <span class='it'>C. pubescens</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small flowered plant affects a moist soil, such as low wet
meadows and open swampy woods; while the larger species, better
known by its more familiar name Moccasin flower, loves the open
woodlands and drier plains; where, in the month of June, it may be
seen beside the gay Painted Cup (<span class='it'>Castilleia coccinea</span>), the Blue Lupine
(<span class='it'>L. perennis</span>), the larger White Trillium, and other lovely wild flowers,
forming a charming contrast to their various colours and no less
varied forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stem of the larger Moccasin flower is thick and leafy, each
bright green, many-nerved leaf sheathing the flowers before they
open. The flowers are from one to three in number; bent forward;
drooping gracefully downwards. The golden sac-like lip is elegantly
striped and spotted with ruby red; the twisted narrow petals, and
sepals, two in number of each kind, are of a pale fawn colour, sometimes
veined and lined with a deeper shade. Like many others of
the genus, the organs of the flower assume a singular and grotesque
resemblance to the face of some animal. On lifting up the fleshy
petal-like middle lobe which protects the stamens and pistil, the face
of an Indian hound may be imagined; the stamens, which are two
in number, situated one on either side of the sterile depressed
central lobe, when the flower is mature, turn of a deep brown, and
resemble two round eyes; the blunt stigma takes the form of the
nose, while the sepals look like ears. There is something positively
comical in the appearance of the ape-like face of <span class='it'>C. spectabile</span>, the
beautiful showy Lady’s Slipper, the description of which will be found
to face the plate in which it forms a prominent feature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most beautiful of all the species is the “<span class='sc'>Stemless Lady’s
Slipper</span>,” <span class='it'>Cypripedium acaule</span>, of which we will treat at some future
time. It bears removal to the garden if planted in a suitable
situation; but all these native flowers require attention to their
peculiar habits and soil, or they will disappoint the expectation of
the cultivator and end in failure. All wild flowers transplanted from
the woods require shade, and bog plants both moisture and shade.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS beautiful flower, the blue Iris, which forms the right hand
figure in the group of Moccasin flowers, abounds all
through Canada, and forms one of the ornaments of our
low sandy flats, marshy meadows and over-flowed lake
shores; it delights in wet muddy soil, and often forms large clumps
of verdure in half-dried up ponds and similar localities. Early in
spring, as soon as the sun has warmed the waters after the melting
of the ice, the sharp sword-shaped leaves escaping from the sheltering
sheath that enfolded them, pierce the moist ground, and appear,
forming beds of brilliant verdure, concealing the swampy soil and
pools of stagnant water below. Late in the month of June the
bursting buds of rich purple begin to unfold, peeping through the
spathe that envelopes them. A few days of sunshine, and the
graceful petals, so soft and silken in texture, so variable in shades of
colour, unfold: the three outer ones reflexed, droop gracefully
downwards, while the three innermost, which are of paler tint,
sharper and stiffer, stand erect and conceal the stamens and petal-like
stigmas, which lie behind them: an arrangement so suitable for
the preservation of the fructifying organs of the flower, that we
cannot fail to behold in it the wisdom of the great Creator. The
structure of the cellular tissue in most water plants, and the smooth
oily surface of their leaves, has also been provided as a means of
throwing off the moisture to which their place of growth must necessarily
expose them; but for this wise provision, which keeps the
surface dry though surrounded with water, the plants would become
overcharged with moisture and rot and decay too rapidly to perfect
the ripening of their seeds—a process often carried on at the bottom
of streams and lakes, as in the case of the Pond-lily and other
aquatics. Our blue Iris, however, does not follow this rule, being
only partly an aquatic, but stands erect and ripens the large bony,
three-sided seeds in a three-sided membraneous pod. The hard
seeds of the <span class='it'>Iris versicolor</span> have been roasted and used as a substitute
for coffee. The root, which is creeping, fleshy and tuberous, is
possessed of medicinal qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present we know of only two varieties of the Iris, <span class='it'>Iris
versicolor</span>, and a tall slender variety with paler blue flowers and
rounder scapes. The former is the handsomer flower, being beautifully
varied with lighter and darker shades of blue, purple and
yellow—the latter shade being at the base of the flower leaves.
These are again veined with delicate lines and veinings of darker
purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name <span class='sc'>Iris</span>, as applied to this genus, was bestowed upon it
by the ancient Greeks, ever remarkable for their appreciation of
the beautiful, on account of the rainbow tinted hues displayed in the
flowers of many of the species; especially are the prismatic colours
shown in the flowers of the large pearly white garden Iris, a plant of
Eastern origin, and also in the Persian or Susian Iris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fleur-de-lis, as it was formerly written, signified whiteness
or purity. This was changed to Fleur-de-luce, a corruption of Fleur-de-Louis.
The blossoms of the plant having been selected by Louis
the Seventh of France as his heraldic bearing in the Holy Wars.
The flowers of the Iris have ever been favourites with the poet, the
architect, and sculptor, as many a fair specimen wrought in stone and
marble, or carved in wood, can testify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fleur-de-lis is still the emblem of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Longfellow’s stanzas to the Iris are very characteristic of that
graceful flower:</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HERE is scarcely to be found a lovelier little plant than the
common marsh Cranberry. It is of a trailing habit, creeping
along the ground, rooting at every joint, and sending
up little leafy upright stems, from which spring long slender
thready pedicels, each terminated by a delicate peach-blossom tinted
flower, nodding on the stalk, so as to throw the narrow pointed
petals upward. The leaves are small, of a dark myrtle-green, revolute
at the edges, whitish beneath, unequally distributed along the
stem. The deep crimson smooth oval berries are collected by the
squaws and sold at a high price in the fall of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are extensive tracts of low, sandy swampy flats in various
portions of Canada, covered with a luxuriant growth of low Cranberries.
These spots are known as <span class='it'>Cranberry Marshes</span>; these places
are generally overflowed during the spring; many interesting and
rare plants are found in these marshes, with mosses and lichens
not to be found elsewhere, low evergreens of the heath family, and
some rare plants belonging to the Orchidaceous tribes, such as the
beautiful Grass-pink (<span class='it'>Calopogon pulchellus</span>), and <span class='it'>Calypso borealis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only is the fruit of the low Cranberry in great esteem for
tarts and preserves, but it is also considered to possess valuable
medicinal properties, having been long used in cancerous affections as
an outward application—the berries in their uncooked state are acid
and powerfully astringent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fruit is successively cultivated for market in many parts of
the Northern States of America, and is said to repay the cost of
culture in a very profitable manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much in request as Cranberries are for household use, it
seems strange that no enterprising person has yet undertaken to
supply the markets of Canada. In suitable soil the crop could hardly
prove a failure, with care and attention to the selection of the plants
at a proper season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cranberry forms one of the sub-orders of the heath family
(Ericaceæ), and its delicate pink-tinted flowers are not less beautiful
than many of the exotic plants of that tribe, which we rear with care
and pains in the green-house and conservatory; yet, growing in our
midst as it were, few persons that luxuriate in the rich preserve that
is made from the ripe fruit, have ever seen the elegant trailing-plant,
with its graceful blossoms and myrtle-like foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The botanical name is of Greek origin, from <span class='it'>oxus</span>, sour, and
<span class='it'>coccus</span>, a berry. The plant thrives best in wet sandy soil and low
mossy marshes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE word Lily is derived from the Celtic, <span class='it'>li</span>, which signifies
whiteness; also from the Greek, <span class='it'>lirion</span>. Probably the
stately Lily of the garden, <span class='it'>Lilium candidum</span>, was the
flower to which the name was first given, from its ivory
whiteness and the exquisite polish of its petals. However that may
be, the name <span class='sc'>Lily</span> is ever associated in our minds with grace and
purity, and reminds us of the Saviour of men, who spake of the lilies
of the field, how they grew and nourished beneath the care of Him
who clothed them in robes of beauty more gorgeous than the kingly
garments of Royal Solomon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir James Smith, one of the most celebrated of English
botanists, suggests that the lilies alluded to by our Lord may have
been <span class='it'>Amarylis latea</span>, or the Golden Lily of Palestine—the bright
yellow blossoms of a plant which abounds in the fields of Judea,
and at that moment probably caught his eye; their glowing colour
aptly illustrating the subject on which he was about to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lily has a wide geographical range, and may be found in
some form in every clime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are Lilies that bloom within the cold influence of the
frigid zone, as well as the more brilliant species that glow beneath
the blazing suns of the equator in Africa and Southern Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Richardson mentions, in his list of Arctic plants, <span class='it'>Lilium
Philadelphicum</span>, our own gorgeous orange (or rather scarlet-spotted
Lily). He remarks that it is called by the Esquimaux “<span class='sc'>Mouse-root</span>,”
from the fact that it is much sought after by the field mice, which
feed upon the root. The porcupine also digs for it in the sandy soil
in which it delights to grow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kamtschatka the <span class='it'>Lilium pomponium</span> is used by the natives as
an article of food; and in Muscovy the white Narcissus is roasted as
a substitute for bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The healing qualities of the large white Lily roots and leaves
are well known, applied in the form of a poultice to sores and boils.
Thus are beauty and usefulness united in this most attractive plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of our artist’s pencil, the <span class='sc'>Orange Lily</span>, is widely
spread over this portion of the American continent, as well as in the
more sunny Western States of North America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We find it, however, more frequently growing on open plain-lands,
where the soil is sandy loam. In partially shaded grassy
thickets in oak-openings, in the months of June and July, it may be
seen mixed with the azure blue Lupine (<span class='it'>Lupinus perennis</span>), the golden
flowered Moccasin (<span class='it'>Cypripedium pubescens</span>), <span class='it'>Pyrola rotundifolia</span> the
large sweet-scented Wintergreen, and other charming summer
flowers. Among these our gay and gorgeous Lily stands conspicuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stem is from 1½ to 2 feet high. The leaves are narrow-pointed;
of a dark green colour, growing in whorls at intervals round the stem.
The flowers are from 1-3; large open bells, of a rich orange-scarlet
within, spotted with purplish-brown or black. The outer surface of
the petals is pale orange; anthers six, on long filaments; pollen of a
brick red, or brown colour; stigma three cleft. The Lily belongs
to the artificial class and order, <span class='it'>Hexandria monogynia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many flowers increase in beauty of colour and size under cultivation
in our gardens, but our glorious Lily can hardly be seen to
greater advantage than when growing wild on the open plains and
prairies, under the bright skies of its native wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But sylvan wooded lanes, and heathery moorlands are not
characters of our Canadian scenery, and if we would seek the Harebell,
we shall find it on the dry gravelly banks of lakes or rivers, or
rocky islets, for these are its native haunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although, in colour and shape of the blossom, the Canadian
flower resembles the British one, it is more robust in its growth,
less fragile—the flower stems being stouter, and the foot-stalk or
pedicel stiffer and less pendulous, and yet sufficiently graceful. The
root leaves, which are not very conspicuous during its flowering
season, are round, heart-shaped. Those of the flower-stem are
numerous, narrow and pointed. This pretty flower is variable in
colour and foliage. Its general flowering season is July and August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corolla is bell-shaped or campanulate; 5 cleft; calyx
lobes, awl shaped, persistent on the seed vessel; stamens 5, style 1,
stigmas 2; seed vessel several celled and many seeded; in height
the plant varies from a few inches to a foot; number of flowers
varying from a few to many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have but three known species in Canada, <span class='it'>Campanula
Americana</span>, “a large handsome species being found in Western
Canada;”<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> and <span class='it'>C. aparinoides</span>. The rough-leaved Bellflower is found
in marshes and in thickets where the soil is poor but the atmosphere
moist; it is of a climbing or rather clinging habit; the weak slender
stem, many branched, laying hold of the grasses and low shrubs that
surround it for support, which its rough teeth enable it to do very
effectually; in habit it resembles the smaller Galium, or Lady’s bedstraw.
The delicate bell-shaped flowers are marked with fine purple
lines within, at the base of the white corolla. The leaves of this
species are narrow-linear, rough, with minutely-toothed hairs; the
flowers are few, and fade very quickly. The name campanula is from
<span class='it'>campana</span>, a bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Harebell has often formed the theme of our modern poets,
as illustrative of grace and lightness. In the Lady of the Lake we
have this pretty couplet when describing Ellen:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of the figure in our plate is the Pink-flowered
Moccasin; it is chiefly to be found in damp ground, in tamarack
swamps, and near forest creeks, where, in groups of several stems, it
appears, showing its pure blossoms among the rank and coarser herbage.
The stem rises to the height of from 18 inches to 2 feet high.
The leaves, which are large, ovate, many nerved and plaited, sheathing
at the base, clothe the fleshy stem, which terminates in a single
sharp pointed bract above the flower. The flowers are terminal, from
one to three, rarely more; though in the large purple and white
Lady’s Slipper, the older and stronger plants will occasionally throw
out three or four blossoms. This variety is found on the dry plain-lands,
in grassy thickets, among the oak openings above Rice Lake,
and eastward on the hills above the River Trent. This is most likely
the plant described by Gray; the soil alone being different. The
unfolded buds of this species are most beautiful, having the appearance
of slightly flattened globes of delicately-tinted primrose coloured
rice paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The large sac-like inflated lip of our Moccasin flower is slightly
depressed in front, tinged with rosy pink and striped. The pale thin
petals and sepals, two of each, are whitish at first, but turn brown
when the flower is more advanced toward maturity. The sepals
may be distinguished from the petals; the former being longer than
the latter, and by being united at the back of the flower. The
column on which the stamens are placed is three-lobed; the two
anthers are placed one on either side, under the two lobes; the
central lobe is sterile, thick, fleshy, and bent down—in our species
it is somewhat blunt and heart-shaped. The stigma is obscurely
three-lobed. The root of the Lady’s Slipper is a bundle of white
fleshy fibres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the remarkable characteristics of the flowers of this
genus, and of many of the natural order to which it belongs, is the
singular resemblance of the organs of the blossom to the face of
some animal or insect. Thus the face of an Indian hound may be
seen in the Golden-flowered <span class='it'>Cypripedium pubescens</span>; that of a sheep or
ram, with the horns and ears, in <span class='it'>C. arietinum</span>; while our “<span class='sc'>Showy
Lady’s Slipper</span>,” (<span class='it'>C. spectabile</span>), displays the curious face and peering
black eyes of the ape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the rarest and, at the same time, the most beautiful of
these flowers, is the “<span class='sc'>Stemless Lady’s Slipper</span>,” (<span class='it'>C. acaule</span>), a
figure of which will appear in our second volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a matter of wonder and also of regret, that so few persons
have taken the trouble to seek out and cultivate the beautiful native
plants with which our country abounds, and which would fully reward
them for their pains, as ornaments to the garden border, the
shrubbery, the rookery, or the green-house. Our orchidaceous
plants alone would be regarded by the foreign florist with great
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A time will come when these rare productions of our soil will
disappear from among us, and can be found only on those waste and
desolate places where the foot of civilized man can hardly penetrate;
where the flowers of the wilderness flourish, bloom and decay
unseen but by the all-seeing eye of Him who adorns the lonely
places of the earth, filling them with beauty and fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For whom are these solitary objects of beauty reserved? Shall
we say with Milton:⁠—</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-O.jpg' style='float:left;width:9%;' alt='O'/>UR Artist has given us in the present plate a charming
specimen of one of our native roses. The early flowering
Rose (<span class='it'>Rosa blanda</span>) is hardly so deeply tinted as our
dwarf wild rose, <span class='it'>rosa lucida</span>, but both possess attractions
of colour and fragrance; qualities that have made the rose to be the
theme, of many a poet’s song. In the flowery language of the East,
beauty and the rose seem almost to be synonymous. The Italian
poets are full of allusions to the rose, especially to the red damask
rose, which they call “purpurea rosa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A popular song in the days of Charles the 1st was that beginning
with the lines⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaves of <span class='it'>rosa blanda</span> are pale underneath; leaflets five to
seven; flowers blush-pink; stem not very prickly; fruit red and
round; the bush from one to three feet in height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another of our dwarf wild roses, <span class='it'>R. lucida</span>, is widely diffused
over Canada; it is found on all open plain-lands, but shuns the deep
shade of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bark of this wild rose is of a bright red, and the young wood
is armed with bristly prickles of a greyish colour. When growing in
shade, the half opened flowers and buds are of a deep pink or carmine,
but where more exposed in sunny spots, the petals fade to a
pale blush-colour. This shrub becomes somewhat troublesome if
encouraged in the garden, from the running roots which send up
many shoots. In its wild state the dwarf rose seldom exceeds three
feet in height; it is the second and older wood that bears the flowers:
the flower bearing branches become almost smooth or only remotely
thorny. The leaflets vary in number from five to nine; they are
sharply serrated at the edges, and smooth on the surface; the globular
scarlet fruit is flattened at the eye; of a pleasant sub-acid taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This beautiful red-barked rose grows in great profusion on the
huckleberry plains above Rice Lake, clothing large tracts of hill and
dale, and scenting the evening air at dew-fall with its delicate fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, or used to be, a delicate pale flowered briar rose, having
small foliage and numerous blossoms of a low branching habit growing
in the high oak-hills in the township of Rawdon. I have never
seen the flowers myself, but have heard the plant described as a rare
species. The <span class='sc'>Swamp Rose</span>, <span class='it'>Rosa Carolina</span>, is not uncommon; it is
often seen growing at the margin of lakes and rivers, and at the edges
of stony islands; it will climb, by aid of supporting trees, to the height
of eight and ten feet. The flowers are of a somewhat purplish tinge
of pink. The leaves are whitish underneath; this rose is armed with
rather stout prickles below on the old woody stem but smoother
above; the flowers are more clustered than in either of the other
species.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sweet briar is often found growing in waste places, and in
thickets near clearings—no doubt the seed has been carried thither
by birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very possible that other varieties of the rose tribe may yet
be found native to Canadian soil, but the above named are our only
known species at present.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE wild Pentstemon is a slender, elegant branching plant, not
unlike in outline to the fox-glove. The flowers are delicately
shaded from white to pale azure-blue, sometimes
varying to deeper blue. The corolla is an inflated slender
tube, somewhat flattened on the upper side, with a rigid line
passing from the base of the tube to the upper lip. There are
also two bearded lines within. The lower lip is three-cleft and
slightly projecting beyond the two-lobed upper lip; the stamens are
five, but one is sterile and thickly beset with fine white hairs (or
bearded). The name is derived from a Greek word signifying <span class='it'>five</span>.
The root leaves are broadly lanceolate and coarsely toothed; the
upper or stem-leaves narrower, and nearly clasping the stem. The
flowers grow on long branching stalks in a loose panicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plant is perennial, from one to two feet in height; it seems
addicted to dry gravelly soil on river banks and dry pastures. The
Beard-tongue would be well worthy of cultivation; though less showy
than the garden varieties, it is not less beautiful and keeps in bloom
a long time, from July to September; it might be mixed with the red
flowering plants of the garden to great advantage.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-P.jpg' style='float:left;width:9%;' alt='P'/>OND-LILY is the popular name by which this beautiful
aquatic plant is known, nor can we find it in our hearts
to reject, the name of <span class='sc'>Lily</span> for this ornament of our lakes.
The White Nymphæa might indeed be termed “Queen
of the Lakes,” for truly she sits in regal pride upon her watery throne,
a very queen among flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very lovely are the Water Lilies of England, but their fair
sisters of the New World excel them in size and fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the tribe to which these plants belong are natives of
the torrid zone, but our White Pond-Lily (<span class='it'>Nymphæa odorata</span>), and
the Yellow (<span class='it'>Nuphar advena</span>), and <span class='it'>Nuphar Kalmiana</span> only, are able to
support the cold winter of Canada. The depth of the water in
which they grow enables them to withstand the cold, the frost rarely
penetrating to their roots, which are rough and knotted, and often
as thick as a man’s wrist; white and fleshy. The root-stock is
horizontal, sending down fibrous slender rootlets into the soft mud;
the stocks that support the leaves and blossoms are round of an
olive-green, containing open pores filled with air, which cause them
to be buoyed up in the water. These air-cells may be distinctly
seen by cutting the stems across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaves of the Pond-Lily are of a full-green colour, deeply
tinged with red toward the fall of the year, so as to give a blood red
tinge to the water; they are of a large size, round kidney shape,
of leathery texture, and highly polished surface; resisting the action
of the water as if coated with oil or varnish. Over these beds of
water-lilies, hundreds of dragon flies of every colour, blue, green,
scarlet, and bronze, may be seen like living gems flirting their pearly
tinted wings in all the enjoyment of their newly found existence;
possibly enjoying the delicious aroma from the odorous lemon
scented flowers over which they sport so gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers of the Pond-Lily grow singly at the summit of the
round, smooth, fleshy scape. Who that has ever floated upon one
of our calm inland lakes, on a warm July or August day, but has
been tempted, at the risk of upsetting the frail birch-bark canoe or
shallow skiff, to put forth a hand to snatch one of those matchless
ivory cups that rest in spotless purity upon the tranquil water, just
rising and falling with the movement of the stream; or have gazed
with wishful and admiring eyes into the still clear water, at the
exquisite buds and half unfolded blossoms that are springing upwards
to the air and sun-light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hollow boat-shaped sepals of the calyx are four in number,
of a bright olive green, smooth and oily in texture. The flowers do
not expand fully until they reach the surface. The petals are numerous,
hollow (or concave), blunt, of a pure ivory white; very fragrant,
having the rich odour of freshly cut lemons; they are set round the
surface of the ovary (or seed-vessel) in regular rows, one above the
other, gradually lessening in size, till they change by imperceptible
gradation into the narrow fleshy petal-like lemon tinted anthers.
The pistil is without style, the stigma forming a flat rayed top to the
ovary, as in the poppy and many other plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the approach of night our lovely water-nymph gradually
closes her petals, and slowly retires to rest within her watery bed,
to rise on the following day, to court the warmth and light so
necessary for the perfection of the embryo seed; and this continues
till the fertilization of the germ has been completed, when the
petals shrink and wither, and the seed-vessel sinks down to ripen
the fruit in its secret chambers. Thus silently and mysteriously does
nature perform her wonderful work, “sought out only by those who
have pleasure therein.”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The roots of the Pond Lily contain a large quantity of fecula
(flour), which, after repeated washings, may be used for food; they
are also made use of in medicine, being cooling and softening; the
fresh leaves are used as good dressing for blisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lotus of Egypt belongs to this family, and not only furnishes
magnificent ornaments with which to crown the heads of their gods
and kings, but the seeds also served as food to the people in times
of scarcity. The Sacred Lotus (<span class='it'>Nelumbium speciosum</span>) was an object
itself of religious veneration to the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chinese, in some places of that over-populated country,
grow the Water Lilies upon their lakes for the sake of the nourishment
yielded by the roots and seeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lotus-eaters,” says that valuable writer on the Medical Botany
of America, Dr. Charles Lee, “not only abound in Egypt, but all
over the East.” “The large fleshy roots of the <span class='it'>Nelumbium luteum</span>,
or great Yellow Water Lily, found in our North American lakes,
resembles the Sweet Potato (<span class='it'>Batatas edulis</span>), and by some of the
natives are esteemed equally agreeable and wholesome,” observes
the same author, “being used as food by the Indians, as well as some
of the Tartar tribes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As yet little value has been attached to this charming plant, the
White Pond Lily, because its uses have been unknown. It is one of
the privileges of the botanist and naturalist to lay open the vegetable
treasures that are so lavishly bestowed upon us by the bountiful
hand of the Great Creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that singular plant, the Eel or Tapegrass, a plant indigenous to our slow flowing waters, the elastic flower-bearing

the pollen-bearing flowers, which are produced at the bottom of the water on very short scapes, and which, united
by the same vegetable instinct, break away from the confining bonds that hold them and rise to the surface, where
they expand and scatter their fertilizing dust upon the fruit-bearing flowers which float around them; these, after a
while, coil up again and draw the pod-like ovary down to the bottom of the water, there to ripen and perfect the
fruit; a curious fact vouched for by Gray and many other creditable botanists.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HE Yellow Pond Lily is often found growing in extensive
beds, mingled with the White, and though it is less graceful
in form, there is yet much to admire in its rich orange-coloured
flowers, which appear at a little distance like
balls of gold floating on the still waters. The large hollow petal-like
sepals that surround the flower are finely clouded with dark red
on the outer side, but of a deep yellow orange within, as also are the
strap-like petals and stamens: the stigma, or summit of the pistil, is
flat, and 12-24 rayed. The leaves are dark-green, scarcely so large
as those of the White Lily, floating on long thick fleshy stalks,
flattened on the inner side, and rounded without. The botanical
name Nuphar is derived, says Gray, from the Arabic word <span class='it'>Neufar</span>,
signifying Pond Lily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Artist has closely followed nature’s own arrangements by
grouping these beautiful water plants together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where there is a deep deposit of mud in the shallows of still
waters we frequently find many different species of aquatics growing
promiscuously. The tall lance-like leaf and blue-spiked heads of
the stately <span class='it'>Pontederia</span>, keeping guard as it were above the graceful
<span class='it'>Nymphæa</span>, like a gallant knight with lance in rest, ready to defend
his queen, and around these the fair and delicate white flowers of
the small arrow-head rest their frail heads upon the water, looking
as if the slightest breeze that ruffled its surface would send them
from their place of rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this aquatic garden lie beds of wild rice <span class='it'>Zizania aquatica</span>,
with its floating leaves of emerald green, and waving grassy flowers
of straw colour and purple—while nearer to the shore the bright
rosy tufts of the Water Persicaria, with its dark-green leaves and
crimson stalks, delight the eyes of the passer-by.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-E.jpg' style='float:left;width:9%;' alt='E'/>VEN the most casual observer can hardly pass a bed of these
most remarkable plants without being struck by their
appearance, indeed, from root to flower, it is every way
worthy of our notice and admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pitcher Plant is by no means one of those flowers found
singly and in inaccessible bogs and dense cedar-swamps, as are
some of our rare and lovely Orchids. In almost any grassy swamp,
at the borders of low lying lakes, and beaver-meadows, often in
wet spongy meadows, it may be found forming large beds of
luxuriant growth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When wet with recent showers or glistening with dew-drops,
the rich crimson veinings of the broadly scalloped lip of the tubular
leaf (which is thickly beset with fine stiff silvery hairs), retaining the
moisture, shine and glisten in the sun-light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The root is thick, solid, and fibrous. The tubular leaves are of
a reddish tinge on the outer and convex side, but of a delicate light
green within. The texture is soft, smooth, and leathery; the base
of the leaf, at the root, is narrow and pipe-stem like, expanding into
a large hollow receptacle, capable of containing a wine-glass full of
liquid; even in dry seasons this cup is rarely found empty. The
hollow form of the leaves, and the broad ewer-like lips, have obtained
for the plant its local and wide-spread name of “Pitcher
Plant,” and “Soldier’s Drinking Cup.” The last name I had from a
poor old emigrant pensioner, when he brought me a specimen of the
plant from the banks of a half dried up lake, near which he was
located: “Many a draft of blessed water have we poor soldiers had
when in Egypt out of the leaves of a plant like this, and we used
to call them the ‘Soldier’s Drinking Cup.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most probably the plant that afforded the <span class='it'>blessed water</span> to the
poor thirsty soldiers was the <span class='it'>Nepenthe distillaria</span>, which plant is found
in Egypt and other parts of Africa. Perhaps there are but few
among the inhabitants of this well-watered country that have as
fully appreciated the value of the <span class='sc'>Pitcher Plant</span> as did our poor
uneducated Irish pensioner, who said that he always thought that
God in His goodness had created the plant to give drink to such as
were athirst on a hot and toilsome march; and so he looked with
gratitude and admiration on its representative in Canada. Many a
lesson may we learn from the lips of the poor and the lowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the inner portion of the leaf there is a wing or flap
which adds to its curious appearance: from the section of the leaf has
arisen the somewhat inappropriate name of “<span class='it'>Side-Saddle Flower</span>.”
The evident use of this appendage is to contract the inner side of
the leaf, and to produce a corresponding rounding of the outer portion,
which is thus thrown back, and enables the moisture more readily
to fill the cup. Quantities of small flies, beetles, and other insects,
enter the pitcher, possibly for shelter, but are unable to effect a
return, owing to the reflexed bristly hairs that line the upper part
of the tube and lip, and thus find a watery grave in the moisture
that fills the hollow below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall stately flower of the Pitcher Plant is not less worthy
of our attention than the curiously formed leaves. The smooth
round simple scape rises from the centre of the plant to the height
of 18 inches to 2 feet. The flower is single and terminal, composed
of 5 sepals, with three little bracts; 5 blunt broad petals of a dull
purplish-red colour, sometimes red and light-yellowish green; and in
one variety the petals are mostly of a pale-green hue, and there is
an absence of the crimson veins in the leafage. The petals are
incurved or bent downwards towards the centre. The stamens are
numerous. The ovary is 5-celled, and the style is expanded at the
summit into a 5 angled, 5 rayed umbrella-like hood, which conceals
beneath it 5 delicate rays, each terminating in a little hooked stigma.
The capsule or seed vessel is 5-celled and 5-valved; seeds numerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have been more minute in the description of this interesting
plant, because much of its peculiar organization is hidden from the
eye, and cannot be recognized in a drawing, unless a strictly
botanical one, with all its interior parts dissected, and because the
Pitcher Plant has lately attracted much attention by its reputed
medicinal qualities in cases of small-pox, that loathsome scourge of
the human race. A decoction from the root of this plant has been
said to lessen all the more violent symptoms of the disorder. If
this be really so, its use and application should be widely spread;
fortunately, the remedy would be in the power of every one; like
many of our sanative herbs it is to be found without difficulty, and
being so remarkable in its appearance can never be mistaken by
the most ignorant of our country herbalists for any injurious substitute.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HIS splendidly-coloured plant is the glory and ornament of
the plain-lands of Canada. The whole plant is a glow
of scarlet, varying from pale flame-colour to the most
vivid vermillion, rivalling in brilliancy of hues the scarlet
geranium of the greenhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Painted Cup owes its gay appearance not to its flowers,
which are not very conspicuous at a distance, but to the deeply-cut
leafy tracts that enclose them and clothe the stalks, forming
at the ends of the flower branches clustered rosettes. (See our
artist’s plate.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flower is a flattened tube, bordered with bright red,
and edged with golden yellow. Stamens, four; pistil, one, projecting
beyond the tube of the calyx; the capsule is many seeded.
The radical or root leaves are of a dull, hoary green, tinged with
reddish purple, as also is the stem, which is rough, hairy, and
angled. The bracts or leafy appendages, which appear on the
lower part of the stalk, are but slightly tinged with scarlet, but
the colour deepens and brightens towards the middle and summit
of the branched stem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scarlet Cup appears in May, along with the smaller white
and red trilliums; but these early plants are small; the stem simple,
rarely branched, and the colour of a deeper red. As the summer
advances, our gallant soldier-like plant puts on all its bravery
of attire. All through the glowing harvest months, the open
grassy plains and the borders of the cultivated fields are enriched
by its glorious colours. In favourable soils the plant rises, enclosed
in a tubular slightly twice-cleft calyx, of a pale green colour, attains
a height of from 2ft. 4in., throwing out many side branches, terminated
by the clustered, brilliantly-tinted bracts; some heads being
as large as a medium-sized rose. They have been gathered in
the corners of the stubble fields on the cultivated plains, as late
as October. A not uncommon slender variety occurs, of a pale buff,
and also of a bright lemon color. The American botanists speak of
<span class='it'>Castilleia coccinea</span>, as being addicted to a low, wettish soil, but it
is not so with our Canadian plant; if you would find it in its
greatest perfection, you must seek it on the high, dry, rolling plains
of Rice-lake, Brantford, to the north of Toronto, Stoney lake, the
neighbourhood of Peterboro, and similar localities; it is neither
to be found in swamps nor in the shade of the uncleared forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For soil, the Scarlet Cup seems to prefer light loam, and
evidently courts the sunshine rather than the shade. If it could
be prevailed upon to flourish in our garden borders, it would be
a great acquisition, from its long flowering time and its brilliant
colouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These lovely plants, like many others that adorn our Canadian
woods and wilds, yearly disappear from our midst, and soon we
shall seek them, but not find them.</p>

many a rare and precious flower of the Orchis family
blooms, flourishes, and decays, unseen by human eye, unsought
by human hand, until some curious, flower-loving
botanist plunges amid the rank, tangled vegetation, and brings
beauties to the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these beautiful Orchids, the <span class='it'>Orchis spectabilis</span> or <span class='sc'>Showy
Orchis</span>, is here presented in our group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This pretty plant is not, indeed, of very rare occurrence; its
locality is rich maple and beechen woods all through Canada.
The colour of the flower is white, shaded, and spotted with pink
or purplish lilac; the corolla is what is termed ringent or throated,
the upper petals and sepals arching over the hollow lower-lipped
petal. The scape is smooth and fleshy, terminating in a loosely-flowered
and many-bracted spike; the bracts are dark-green,
sharp-pointed, and leafy; the root a bundle of round white fibres;
the leaves, two in number, are large, blunt, oblong, shining,
smooth, and oily, from three to five inches long, one larger than
the other. The flowering time of the species is May and June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our forest glades and boggy swamps hide many a rare and
precious flower known but to few; among some of the most beautiful
of this interesting group of plants, we might direct attention to
the elegant and rare <span class='it'>Calypso borealis</span>, <span class='it'>Pogonia triphoria</span>, and
<span class='it'>Pogonia pendula</span>. The beautiful Grass Pink, <span class='it'>Calopogon pulchellus</span>,
with many others of the Orchidaceæ tribe, may be regarded
as flower gems to be prized alike for their exquisite forms and
colouring as for their scarcity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These lovely Orchids, transplanted to the greenhouse or
conservatory, would be regarded as objects of great interest, but
are rarely seen and little valued by the careless passer-by, if he

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/Drop-the.jpg' style='float:left;width:8%;' alt='T'/>HERE are two species of Arums common to Canada, the
larger of which is known as Green-dragon (<span class='it'>Arum Dracontium</span>);
the other, which forms the central figure in the
plate, is the most common to our soil, and is known by
the familiar name of <span class='sc'>Indian Turnip</span> (<span class='it'>Arum triphyllum</span> or <span class='it'>A.
purpureum</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These moisture-loving plants are chiefly to be found in rich
black, swampy mould, beneath the shade of trees and rank herbage,
near creeks and damp places, in or about the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheath that envelops and protects the spadix, or central
portion of the plant, is an incurved membraneous hood of a pale
green colour, beautifully striped with dark purple or brownish-purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers are inconspicuous, hidden by the sheath; they
are of two kinds, the sterile and fertile, the former placed above,
the latter consisting of four or more stamens and 2 4-celled
anthers, the fertile or fruit-bearing flowers of a one-celled ovary.
The fruit, when ripe, is bright scarlet, clustered round the lower
part of the round fleshy scape. As the berries ripen, the hood
or sheath withers and shrivels away to admit the ripening rays
of heat and light to the fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The root of the Indian Turnip consists of a round, wrinkled,
fleshy corm, somewhat larger than that of the garden crocus;
from this rises the simple scape or stem of the plant, which is
sheathed with the base of the leaves. These are on long naked
stalks, divided into three ovate pointed leaflets, waved at the edges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The juices of the Indian Turnip are hot, acrid, and of a
poisonous quality, but can be rendered useful and harmless by the
action of heat; the roots roasted in the fire are no longer poisonous.
The Indian herbalists use the Indian Turnip in medicine as a
remedy in violent colic, long experience having taught them in
what manner to employ this dangerous root.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Arum belongs to a natural order, most plants of which
contain an acrid poison, yet under proper care can be made valuable
articles of food. Among these we may mention the roots
of <span class='it'>Colocosia mucronatum</span>, <span class='it'>violaceum</span>, and others, which, under the
more familiar names of <span class='sc'>Eddoes</span> and <span class='sc'>Yams</span>, are in common use
in tropical countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The juice of <span class='it'>Arum triphyllum</span>, our Indian Turnip, has been
used, boiled in milk, as a remedy for consumption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Portland sago is prepared from the larger species, <span class='it'>Arum
maculatum</span>, Spotted Arum. The corm, or root, yields a fine, white,
starchy powder, similar to Arrow-root, and is prepared much in the
same way as potato starch. The pulp, after being ground or
pounded, is thrown into clean water and stirred; the water, after
settling, is poured off, and the white sediment is again submitted
to the same process until it becomes quite pure, and is then dried.
A pound of this starch may be made from a peck of the roots.
The roots should be dried in sand before using. Thus purified and
divested of its poisonous qualities, the powder so procured becomes
a pleasant and valuable article of food, and is sold under the name
of Portland Sago, or Portland Arrow-root.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When deprived of the poisonous acrid juices that pervade
them, all our known species may be rendered valuable both as
food and medicine; but they should not be employed without care
and experience. The writer remembers, not many years ago,
several children being poisoned by the leaves of <span class='it'>Arum triphyllum</span>
being gathered and eaten as greens, in one of the early-settled
back townships of Western Canada. The same deplorable accident
happened by ignorant persons gathering the leaves of the Mandrake
or May Apple (<span class='it'>Podophyllum pellatum</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seems in the vegetable world, as well as in the moral,
two opposite principles, the good and the evil. The gracious God
has given to man the power, by the cultivation of his intellect, to
elicit the good and useful, separating it from the vile and injurious,
thus turning that into a blessing which would otherwise be a curse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Arum family possess many valuable medicinal qualities,”
says Dr. Charles Lee, in his valuable work on the medicinal plants
of North America, “but would nevertheless become dangerous
poisons in the hands of ignorant persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The useful Cassava, (<span class='it'>Zanipha Manipor</span>), of the West Indies
and tropical America, is another remarkable instance of art overcoming
nature, and obtaining a positive good from that which
in its natural state is evil. The Cassava, from the flour of which
the bread made by the natives is manufactured, being the starchy
parts of a poisonous plant of the Euphorbia family, the milky
juice of which is highly acrid and poisonous. The pleasant and
useful article sold in the shops under the name of tapioca is also
made from the Cassava root.</p>

Cone Flower:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plant is from one to three feet in height, the stem simple, or
branching, each branchlet terminating in a single head. The rays are
of a deep orange colour, varying to yellow; the leaves broadly lanceolate,
sometimes once or twice lobed, partly clasping the rough,
hairy stem, hoary and of a dull green, few and scattered. The
scales of the chaffy disk are of a dark, shining purple, forming
a somewhat depressed cone. This species, with a slenderer-stemmed
variety, with rays of a golden yellow, are to be met
with largely diffused over the Province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many splendid species of the Cone Flower are to be found

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
